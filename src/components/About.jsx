      Hey, I'm Himanshu Choudhary — a Full Stack Developer and AI Enthusiast with a love for crafting powerful, user-friendly web applications that actually make a difference. Whether it’s frontend finesse or backend logic, I thrive on turning complex ideas into clean, functional digital solutions.

My tech journey began with a simple curiosity about how things work — now, it’s evolved into a full-blown obsession with building, learning, and experimenting. I’m especially passionate about artificial intelligence, React, and anything that challenges me to think differently. Let’s just say: I never stop leveling up.
